What's left to cover from API side:

Client, auth and related methods:
    * auth.getMobileSession + others
    * album.addtags
    * album.removetag
    * artist.addtags
    * artist.removetag
    * track.love
    * track.scrobble
    * track.unlove
    * track.updateNowPlaying

Refactoring:
    * add "not found" kind of tests
    * remove Option<> from where it's not needed - Url, str_to_val
    * organize response data types so that they are intuitive to import (maybe add lastfm::user etc mods with reexports from lastfm::structs:: ..?)
